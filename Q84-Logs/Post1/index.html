        <p>hi this is my first blog post. admittedly i made this blog more as a thing to put in my portfolio like haha i can make a 
            website with the bare minimum and so admittedly i might not put much on it but then again i can just yap like this in order to put shit.  i'm also just like not gonna be going back and editting any of this i'll treat it more as a diary i guess 
            hmmm i guess if you wanted to know more about me i'm like the greatest project moon gamer in the world add me on limbus<img src="/images/limbus1.png">
            but yeah im cracked on limbus. i obviously love hello charlotte clearly its a masterpiece showing the cruelty of reality and why authors write fiction. its really moving cause its honest. 
            it's not just a show or just entertainment it's someone who couldn't express themselves expressing everything they were through an rpgmaker game. <img src="/images/true.png">
            hmm i also like movies i rewatched drive last night with C and its sigma asf but to be honest i love the movie and its incredible soundtrack. the message about going against your own nature also really resonated with me as what makes humans special is their ability to fight their nature and win
            </p>

            <p>what else should i yap about hmmmm. i guess i don't have much else to talk about other than my evil dark history (this is partially a joke). 
                i also like anime and manga obviously i will forever rep dragon ball. i also really like monster and gurren lagann. gameswise i love metal gear, rpgmakers, devil may cry, roblox (sometimes), and probably more  i cant think of right now lol.
                favorite from the bunch would definetly go to metal gear and hello charlotte though for obvious reasons. i'm also a truer and a friend lover and the scp secret lab demon. 
                i need everyone to go dm sh_xq on discord about Batman (mass = 91 kg) jumps straight down from a bridge into a boat (mass = 510 kg) in which a criminal is fleeing. The velocity of the boat is initially 11 m/s. What is the velocity of the boat after Batman lands in it?
                actually that just reminded me that i really liked comics as well please read the unwritten and the sandman or like anything from vertigo its actually peak fiction.  
                <img src="/images/unwritten.png">
                i'm the og faceless macro demon (ignore if you don't know).
                anyways i'm q84  i don't really care all too much about shit admittedly.
                i'll continue writing random ass blog posts like this from time to time or just talk about shit like how a cpus made for probably no reason other than i found it interesting. anyways i'm gonna publish this and go shower now k thx for reading.
